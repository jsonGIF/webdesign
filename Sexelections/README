The ‘Sex Elections’ is a project created by four Hyper Island students. Working with a data set created by United Minds surveying over 3000 people in a national health study about the Swedes' sex habits, we choose to see if we could create stories around political and sexual preferences.

For the sake of simplicity we decided to focus on Sweden’s two biggest parties: the Social Democrats and the Moderaterna. Looking at the views of a total of 1256 people we’re treating selected questions in the dataset as small “elections” where we set out to find the prefered sexposition of the parties. Which party is having the most sex and where are they having it? The wins is determined in percentages.
